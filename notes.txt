server:
email comes in
goes to emails


sorter:
looks for emails without 

client:
looks for emails that need forwarding on to another MTA
how do we determine this?
-> if the recipient is local, we don't need to foward
how do we determine if the recipient is local?
-> have a table of local_users
-> if recipient is in local_users, we deliver locally
what does it mean to deliver locally?
-> I think in this case it makes sense to store the email in a new table,
  local_messages or something

server:
save new emails in emails

sorter:
look for emails with `type IS NULL`
if recipient is local, set `type = 'local'`
else, set `type = 'remote'`

client:
look for emails with `type = 'remote'`
connect to remote server and deliver


database tables:

emails
local_users
